## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in *Power BI* by analyzing a dataset of global COVID-19 data. It focuses on presenting key metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases using a variety of Power BI visuals and interactive features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is a CSV file containing country-wise COVID-19 data. Key columns include:

- Country: Name of the country
- Confirmed Cases: Total confirmed COVID-19 cases
- Deaths: Total number of deaths
- Recovered: Total number of recovered patients
- Active Cases: Calculated as Confirmed Cases - Deaths - Recovered

### Data Source

The dataset was obtained from a publicly available source and preprocessed using Power BI before generating insights.


## Visualizations

This project includes the following *7 visuals*:

1. *Bar Chart*: Total confirmed cases by country
2. *Line Chart*: Time-based trend of daily cases, recoveries, and deaths
3. *Map Visual*: Geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases across countries
4. *Gauge Chart*: Visual representation of active cases compared to total cases
5. *Stacked Bar Chart*: Breakdown of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries
6. *Pie Chart*: Death rate and recovery rate visualization

## Interactive Features

To enhance the user experience, the report includes the following interactive elements:

- *Buttons*: Navigation buttons for smooth transitions between different report pages.
- *Images*: Relevant images, such as world maps and country flags, to make the report visually engaging.

## Insights

### Key Insights Derived from the Data:

- *Global Overview*: As of the latest data, Country X has the highest confirmed cases, followed by Country Y. The death rate is Z%, while the recovery rate is W%.
- *Country-wise Breakdown*: The top 10 countries with the highest confirmed cases account for N% of global cases.
- *Trends*: A significant spike in cases occurred in June 2020, with a gradual decrease in deaths following that period.

These insights are further elaborated upon in the report, where data trends and patterns are visualized effectively.
